# JRPGfx [WIP][Prototype]
A small javafx game framework built with role playing games in mind.<br><br>
This is what I am currently using to develop my very first RPG.

<em>NOTE: This project is still new and under development. Many modules and features are still missing for this to be used to make a complete rpg.</em>
