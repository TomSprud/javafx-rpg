# my javafx game framework [WIP][Prototype]
A small java game framework that I am building for my upcoming project(s).<br><br>

<em>NOTE: This project is still new and under development. Many planned modules and features are still missing.</em>

### Things you need:
- This, the framework
- Java 8 (I am currently using jdk1.8.0_112)

You can use any IDE you want, but <em>I recommend</em> [JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for developing your projects. It's a very awesome IDE and I just love using it.
