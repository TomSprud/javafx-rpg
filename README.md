# jRPGfx [WIP][Prototype]
A small javafx game framework built with role playing games in mind.<br><br>
This is what I am currently using to develop my very first RPG.

<em>NOTE: This project is still new and under development. Many modules and features are still missing for this to be used to make a complete rpg.</em>

### Things you need:
- jRPGfx (this)
- Java 8 (recommended; I am currently developing this with jdk1.8.0_112)

You can use any IDE you want, but <em>I recommend</em> [JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for developing your projects. It's a very awesome IDE and I just love using it.
